Subject: [PATCH 1/2] dnsproxy: Avoid 100 % busy loop in TCP server case

Once the TCP socket is connected and until the remote server is
responding (if ever) ConnMan executes a 100 % CPU loop, since
the connected socket will always be writable (G_IO_OUT).

To fix this, modify the watch after the connection is established to
remove the G_IO_OUT from the callback conditions.

Fixes: CVE-2022-23098
