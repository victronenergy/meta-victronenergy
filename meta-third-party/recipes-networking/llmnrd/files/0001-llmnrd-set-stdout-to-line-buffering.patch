Subject: [PATCH] llmnrd: set stdout to line buffering

The log output of llmnrd works well when operated from a terminal; but not when its
stdout is piped to a log-file or -tool; due to buffering:

   By default, stdout is buffered (line buffered if connected to a
   terminal), and stderr is unbuffered. [1]

Changing stdout to line buffering fixes this.
