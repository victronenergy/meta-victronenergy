Subject: [PATCH 3/3] package.json: add socketcan package

Venus OS no longer installes packages listed as optional [1]. This also applies
to dependencies in the tree.

canboatjs[2], the package used by signalk for N2K communication, has socketcan
defined as an optional, hence add it here as needed.
