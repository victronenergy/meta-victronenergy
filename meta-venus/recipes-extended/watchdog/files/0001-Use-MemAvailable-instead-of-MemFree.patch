Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Use MemAvailable instead of MemFree

MemFree does not include cached pages and hence underestimates the
amount of memory that _could_ be freed when needed. MemFree + Cached
is a better estimate, but it's not quite right either since Cached
includes things that can't be freed.  For this reason, kernels since 3.14
include a MemAvailable field which provides a more accurate approximation.
See https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/patch/?id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773

Note: This patch blindly assumes MemAvailable is present!!!
Completely unsuitable for general use, since the device ends up in a
reboot loop in such a case...
