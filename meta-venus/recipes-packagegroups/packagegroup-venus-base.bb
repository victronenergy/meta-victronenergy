SUMMARY = "Base packages for venus."
DESCRIPTION = " \
    This packagegroup should contain packages / tools etc for the base \
    venus system to get a bootable system with common tools, common for \
    all MACHINE's we support, but not doing anything useful and build \
    base packages available for download. High level applications typically \
    should not be here, since they can run on Angstrom / Debian etc as well. \
    Or to put it the other way around, packages which are basic distro \
    choises end up here. \
    \
    The image determines what to ship in the end, not suprisingly a venus \
    image would ship venus-base + ve-*, but shipping a angstrom-base + \
    ve-*-apps should work as well (at least in theory) \
    \
    note: machine specific venus base recipes are in packagegroup-venus-machine \
    (yes the base is missing, but it is already a long enough name. It is just \
    to make this packagegroup not machine specific, so bitbake doesn't \
    deinstall and reinstall everything when switching MACHINE's, but can just leave \
    or use the sstate package) \
    \
    note: For machines without any display or monitor simple-upnp / \
    javascript-vnc-client suddenly become base packages, since it is the / \
    only way to connect with them easily. I guess those should be moved to \
    packagegroup-venus-machine and depend on a MACHINE feature. \
