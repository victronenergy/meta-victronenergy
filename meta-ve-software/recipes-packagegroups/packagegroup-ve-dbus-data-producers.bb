DESCRIPTION = "dbus services which provide measurements / data on the dbus"

# To make sure all packages needed by vrmlogger, gui etc get correctly installed
# all these recipes need to RDEPEND on all services they listen too. And if another
# is added all recipes must then be altered to include the new one. By rdepending
# on this packagegroup instead there is only one location where new packages which
# provide data on the dbus need to be added.

inherit packagegroup

# List of application which provide data on the dbus in a VBusItem interface.
# These are RRECOMMENDS so the are only included when available.
