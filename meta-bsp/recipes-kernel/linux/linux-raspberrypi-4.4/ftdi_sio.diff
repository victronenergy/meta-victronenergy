Subject: USB: serial: ftdi_sio: fix extreme low-latency setting

Since commit 557aaa7ffab6 ("ft232: support the ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY
flag") the FTDI driver has been using a receive latency-timer value of
1 ms instead of the device default of 16 ms.

The latency timer is used to periodically empty a non-full receive
buffer, but a status header is always sent when the timer expires
including when the buffer is empty. This means that a two-byte bulk
message is received every millisecond also for an otherwise idle port as
long as it is open.

Let's restore the pre-2009 behaviour which reduces the rate of the
status messages to 1/16th (e.g. interrupt frequency drops from 1 kHz to
62.5 Hz) by not setting ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY by default.

Anyone willing to pay the price for the minimum-latency behaviour should
set the flag explicitly instead using the TIOCSSERIAL ioctl or a tool
such as setserial (e.g. setserial /dev/ttyUSB0 low_latency).

Note that since commit 0cbd81a9f6ba ("USB: ftdi_sio: remove
tty->low_latency") the ASYNC_LOW_LATENCY flag has no other effects but
to set a minimal latency timer.
